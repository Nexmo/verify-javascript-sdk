# The Verify SDK will shut down effective 14th November, 2018. 

## To assist with a seamless migration to the Verify API, we have prepared [technical documentation](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2018/05/10/nexmo-verify-api-implementation-guide-dr/) that will guide you in implementing the Verify API into your client side applications.

# Nexmo Verify SDK for JavaScript

You use Nexmo Verify to verify that a user has access to a specific phone number. Nexmo sends a PIN code in an SMS or Text-To-Speech, your user enters this PIN into your App, you validate the PIN with Nexmo. With Verify SDK for JavaScript you easily integrate Verify functionality into your App.

In order to implement the Verify SDK for JavaScript:
* [Setting up your environment](https://docs.nexmo.com/verify/verify-sdk-for-javascript): before you start coding, create a Verify SDK app in the Dashboard and configure for JavaScript.
* [Integrating Verify SDK for JavaScript](https://docs.nexmo.com/verify/verify-sdk-for-javascript/integration): create and run your first App.
* [API reference](https://docs.nexmo.com/verify/verify-sdk-for-javascript/api-reference): check the parameters for the calls in Verify SDK for JavaScript
